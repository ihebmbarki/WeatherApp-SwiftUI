# Weather App
A weather forecasting app built using SwiftUI and the Open-Meteo API. The app provides both daily and hourly weather forecasts, with a user-friendly interface and city search functionality.
The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns, with the ViewModel handling business logic and API calls, while the View focuses on presenting data and responding to user interactions.

# Features
- City Search: Search for cities with autocomplete suggestions using MKLocalSearchCompleter.
- Daily Forecast: Displays a 7-day weather forecast with weather icons, temperature, and conditions.
- Hourly Forecast: Toggle to view hourly weather for a selected city with on-demand data fetching.
- Dynamic UI: Built entirely using SwiftUI with programmatic UI components.
